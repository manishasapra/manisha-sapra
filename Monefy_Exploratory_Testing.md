|---------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Core functionality of the application | P0 â€“ Critical | Core functionalities, must be stable.                                                                                |

## Risk Areas & Recommendations
* **Study user trends:** We need to make sure on what kind of devices `Monefy` application is running and make sure to include environment testing for those.
* **Most used functionality:** We can setup monitors to make sure which functionality is amoung the most used one and prepare proper plans for it.
* **Data safety and security:** Data is the key and we need to make sure that the data is safe, secure and available all time even after the upgrade and rollback.
* **Subscription:** User is more sensitive when money is involved, we need to make sure that payment success, failure and rollback are being handled properly
